# Report Generation

When creating reports, follow this structure:

## 1. Define the Audience

Before writing:

- Who will read this report?
- What decisions will it inform?
- What level of technical detail is appropriate?
- What format is expected?

## 2. Structure the Report

Use a clear structure:

### Executive Summary
- Key findings (2-3 bullet points)
- Recommendations
- Critical actions needed

### Background
- Context and objectives
- Scope of analysis
- Data sources used

### Methodology
- Approach taken
- Tools and techniques used
- Assumptions made

### Findings
- Organize by theme or importance
- Use data to support claims
- Include visualizations where helpful

### Recommendations
- Prioritized action items
- Expected outcomes
- Resource requirements

### Appendix
- Detailed data
- Technical notes
- Supporting materials

## 3. Write Clearly

Follow these principles:

- Lead with conclusions, then evidence
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include tables for comparisons
- Avoid jargon unless necessary
- Define technical terms

## 4. Use Markdown Effectively

Format for readability:

```markdown
## Section Header

Key insight or finding here.

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Sales  | $10M  | +15%   |
| Users  | 50K   | +25%   |

### Subsection

- Point one with **emphasis**
- Point two with `code reference`
- Point three with [link](url)
```

## 5. Include Visualizations

When appropriate:

- Tables for structured data
- ASCII charts for simple trends
- Describe complex visualizations

Example table:
```
| Category    | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Completed   | 150   | 75%        |
| In Progress | 30    | 15%        |
| Pending     | 20    | 10%        |
```

## 6. Review and Refine

Before delivering:

- Check accuracy of claims
- Verify calculations
- Ensure logical flow
- Proofread for clarity

## Best Practices

- Be concise but complete
- Support claims with evidence
- Make recommendations actionable
- Format for scanning
- Include next steps
