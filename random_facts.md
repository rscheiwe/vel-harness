## Octopus Intelligence
Did you know that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of the body. Their blue blood comes from a copper-based protein called hemocyanin, which is more efficient than our iron-based hemoglobin in cold, low-oxygen environments. Octopuses are also incredibly intelligent - they can solve puzzles, use tools, and even recognize individual humans!

## Honey Never Spoils
Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an environment where bacteria cannot survive. Additionally, bees add an enzyme called glucose oxidase that breaks down into hydrogen peroxide, giving honey natural antibacterial properties.
